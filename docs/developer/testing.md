**Staging Server and Mobile App Testing Instructions**

**1. Testing API on Staging Server**

* **Staging Server URL** : Access the staging server for API testing at `https://sandbox.sevi.io/graphql`.
* **Purpose** : This staging environment is ideal for testing API interactions in a controlled setting before deploying to production.

**2. Registering for Mobile App Testing**

* **Registration Process** : If you wish to test the mobile app in conjunction with the staging server, you must first register for access.
* **Contact Support** : Please reach out to our support team to initiate the registration process for mobile app testing.

**3. Accessing Staging Environment on Mobile and Server**

* **Google PlayStore Email Requirement** : To gain access to the staging version of the mobile app, share your Google PlayStore email with us.
* **Invitation Process** : Once your email is received, we will send you an invitation to join the staging version of the app.
* **Comprehensive Testing** : This approach allows you to test the integration and functionality on both the server and mobile platforms seamlessly.

 **Note** : The staging environment is a replica of the production environment but is isolated to ensure safe and effective testing of new features and bug fixe
