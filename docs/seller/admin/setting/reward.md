![reward](image/agent/reward.png)

The Customer Loyalty Rewards Program is designed to increase customer retention by converting transaction fees into redeemable points. This incentivizes repeat purchases through a straightforward cashback system that benefits both buyers and sellers.

## Key Benefits

- **For Buyers**: Transaction fees are converted into reward points for future purchases
- **For Sellers**: Increased customer loyalty with zero additional cost

## How It Works


### Earning Rewards
1. When a customer makes a purchase, the transaction fee is automatically converted into reward points
2. Points are credited to the customer's account immediately after order completion
3. Points are seller-specific and can only be redeemed with the original seller

### Redeeming Rewards
- Points can be applied to any future eligible purchase
- Customers can choose to accumulate points across multiple orders
- Redemption is automatic through the credit configuration system

## Example Transaction
