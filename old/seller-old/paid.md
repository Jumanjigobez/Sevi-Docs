# Secure payment before dispatch

When uploading orders to Sevi before dispatch you as a seller, can encounter two scenarios:

1) the buyer has available “Sevi Pay Later” limit.
2) the buyer does not have available “Sevi Pay Later” limit.
   Below is a guide to help you navigate both scenarios.

### **Buyer with available “Sevi Pay Later” limit**

When placing an order for a buyer who has an available **GREEN** color “Sevi Pay Later” limit, the order amount will be reserved on the buyer’s account for that specific order. Once the buyer confirms the order as “Delivered,” the reserved balance will be transferred to your seller account.

If the order is marked as “Archived,” the reserved balance will be released back to the buyer’s account. An order can be archived by the seller, an agent, the buyer, or automatically after a set period of time.

In the Admin Portal, buyers with an available “Sevi Pay Later” limit will be displayed as follows:

### Buyer without available “Sevi Pay Later” limit

When creating an order for a buyer who does not have an available “Sevi Pay Later” limit, the order amount will not be reserved. In this case, while you can still proceed with the order, we cannot guarantee upfront that the buyer will be able to pay upon delivery. 

If you create an order with the **RED** color. Make sure that order creation you wait for the buyer to pay for the remaning amount directly. Only when the buyer has paid off any open credit to Sevi before delivery, this buyer is able to use the Sevi payment option on delivery. 

In the Admin Portal, buyers with no available “Sevi Pay Later” limit will appear like this:

### **Delivery**

For a smooth delivery, it is essential that the buyer confirms the order is “Delivered”. Confirming delivery can be done by using the Sevi USSD menu or the Sevi app. Once the order is confirmed as delivered, the buyer will receive a delivery code. This code acts as proof of payment and can be shared with the delivery driver or agent. The driver can verify this delivery code throuhg the Sevi USSD menu. Additionally, you can verify that the order has been paid by entering the delivery code on the Sevi Admin Portal.

### **Receiving** payment and Credit start

Once the order is delivered, the buyer’s credit will commence, and you, the seller, will instantly receive the payment.
