## Verify payment
Click `Verify payment` to verify the selected payment plan with your customer. Your customer is send a verification code (OTP) by SMS, to give its consent with the order and selected payment plan. Please ask you customer for this verification code (OTP) and fill it out. 

> **NOTE:** when you verify the payment plan with your customer, we verify whether your customer has sufficient balance in its Sevi account to pay for the deposit. When the balance of their Sevi account does not suffice to pay for the deposit, you will be instructed to ask them to Top-up their Sevi account before you can fill-out the OTP. Your customer receives an SMS with payment instructions as well including the amount, Paybill number and account number.

When the deposit amount is in your customers Sevi account, you can proceed with filling out the verification code (OTP).
