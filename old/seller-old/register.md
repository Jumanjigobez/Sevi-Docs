To start the KYC process, click the non registered customer's phone number. Follow the prompts on the screen to fill-out to following details:
- Take a photo of ID card of customer
- Take a portrait photo of customer

Uploading of documents might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

> **NOTE:** Take a picture of the ID in a well-lit environment. Ensure all four corners of the document are visible, and there are no reflections (if your phone’s flashlight is on, be sure to switch it off). Clean the lens, hold the phone steady, and align the camera for your ID to fit the frame. Proceed to take the picture and ensure that the information on it is legible. If you’re not sure of the quality, you can retake the photo.

## Get customer consent
Since you perform all actions on behalf of your customer, you are legally obliged to get consent of your customer to create a Sevi account in their name. To verify consent of the customer, the customer is send a verification code (OTP) by SMS. 

Ask your new customer for this verification code (OTP) and enter it.
