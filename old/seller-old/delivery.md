# Step 4: Delivery

When the customer has accepted the payment plan and paid the deposit amount. You are now ready to deliver the order. The order status should be *'Purchased order'*, this means the order and payment plan have been accepted by the customer and the deposit has been paid.

:::note
Changing the status to delivered is crucial, since the new status triggers:
- Payment plan to start running
- Advance payment to your companies wallet

## Set to delivered
On delivery you need to manual set the status of the order from *'Purchased order'* to *'Delivered order'*.

Go to the `Customers` section and click the relevant customer. Click `Set as Delivered` to change the status. 

:::caution
When the order status is *'Pending order'*, you should NOT deliver the order, as the deposit has not been paid yet. Only deliver the order when the status is *'Purchased order'*
